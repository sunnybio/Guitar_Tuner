A simple Guitar Tuner.

For the input audio stream using python library sounddevice.

Which give us audio in form of signal vs time.

Using DFT we will get the magnitude spectrum of the audio.

then finding the frequency with max magnitude we know the note closest to the frequecy and then can tune the guitar.
